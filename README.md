# leolani-mmai-parent

Parent repository for the Leolani App. This repository uses Python 3.9.

This repository contains all components of the Leolani app as _git_ submodules and can be used as the root to
execute [build commands](https://github.com/leolani/cltl-build/tree/main/make) that are run on the components.

For a description of the Leolani App see to the [README](https://github.com/leolani/cltl-leolani-app) there.

## Check-out

To check out all code needed for the Leolani App, clone this repository including all submodules:

        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/leolani/leolani-mmai-parent.git

Checkout the current state of the parent

        git checkout --recurse-submodules

Update to the current branch heads of the submodules:

        git submodule update --remote

## Run the application

Checkout the repository as described in [Check-out](#check-out). Then go to the repository root, build the project,
activate the virtual environment for the Python application and run it. Altogether:

        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/leolani/leolani-mmai-parent.git
        cd leolani-mmai-parent
        make build
        cd cltl-leolani-app
        source venv/bin/activate
        cd py-app
        python app-leo.py

NOTES:

- Remember to launch GraphDB and have a repository called 'sandbox'
- Remember to use the virtual environment (created by the `make build`command) located at `cltl-leolani-app/venv`
- You will need to make a folder as such

```bash
mkdir cltl-leolani-app/py-app/data/ 
mkdir cltl-leolani-app/py-app/data/scenarios
```

### Troubleshooting

[comment]: <> (To remove)

- Using the right branches: Make sure to have the right versions of the submodules by pulling the correct branch:

```bash
cd ../cltl-knowledgeextraction
git checkout integration
cd ../cltl-knowledgerepresentation
git checkout integration
cd ../cltl-languagegeneration
git checkout integration
```

- Git submodules: Usually if running the `make build` command fails and complains about missing makefiles the git
  submodule checkout didnâ€™t work properly. You will need to go to the specific submodule and run the checkout in that
  folder. For example, the error:

``` bash
util/make/makefile.parent.mk:57: /Users/selbaez/Documents/PhD/leolani/leolani-mmai-parent/cltl-face-recognition/makefile.d: No such file or directory
```

Would need to got to the `face-recognition` module and run:

``` bash 
cd cltl-face-recognition
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- Make build: Sometimes, you will need to run `make build` twice, as some errors get fixed only through the first run
